Update 28-02-2021; program made by Tomasz Salwa in 2018 for a 3D nonlinear hyperelastic beam works again.

Todo:
- make small-amplitude test case with exact solution in small-amplitude limit;
- make finite-amplitude test case for lithostatic rest state, so add gravity and linear momentum damping such that rest state becomes steady-state limit for large times; and,
- make test case with figure and such for reproduction and testing.
